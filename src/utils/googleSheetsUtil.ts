/**
 * Instructions for connecting to real Google Sheets:
 * 
 * 1. Create a Google Sheet with columns for: name, role, country, bio, image
 * 2. Make the sheet public or share it with appropriate permissions
 * 3. Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Sheets API
 * 4. Create an API key or service account credentials
 * 5. For a production application, use these credentials in a server-side function
 *    (like a Supabase Edge Function) to avoid exposing your API key in client-side code
 * 
 * For a full implementation, you'd replace the dummy data with an actual API call:
 * 
 * const SHEET_ID = 'your-google-sheet-id';
 * const API_KEY = 'your-api-key'; // Better to keep in server-side environment variable
 * const RANGE = 'Sheet1!A2:E20'; // Adjust as needed
 * 
 * const response = await fetch(
 *   `https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/${SHEET_ID}/values/${RANGE}?key=${API_KEY}`
 * );
 * const data = await response.json();
 * 
 * // Map the response data to your TeamMember interface
 * const teamMembers = data.values.map(row => ({
 *   name: row[0],
 *   role: row[1],
 *   country: row[2],
 *   bio: row[3],
 *   image: row[4] || null
 * }));
